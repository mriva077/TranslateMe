## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Challenges Encountered:

* Implementing a smooth and responsive dropdown selection for language choices took additional debugging.

* Managing API rate limits when fetching translations required handling request optimizations.

* Ensuring accurate text-to-speech pronunciation across different languages was a challenge.

* Implementing offline translation required additional research and integration of a local translation model.
